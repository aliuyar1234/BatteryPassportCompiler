# API Contracts

**Feature**: 01-foundation

## Note

This feature establishes infrastructure only (build system, Docker, CI/CD, database schema, migrations, scripts).

There are **no API contracts** for this feature since no HTTP endpoints or external APIs are implemented.

API contracts will be defined in later features:
- **06-api-server**: REST API endpoints
- **08-advanced-features**: Webhook delivery, GraphQL
